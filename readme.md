# Tamagotchi ðŸ‘¾

Manage your Tamagotchi's vital stats using action buttons. Keep an eye on its hunger and energy levels, ensuring they never dip below 6 to maintain optimal health.

Click an action button once to initiate an activity. Easily switch between actions by clicking on a different one, or effortlessly halt the current action by clicking it again.

Neglecting your Tamagotchi's needs could lead to a decline in health, and when health hits 0, the game is over. The Restart button will appear, allowing you a fresh start.



This is a Nerdboard.io practice project. More information in video below:
